This is a Spring MVC web-application that I created during my Spring MVC practical training. That's the list what I learned during this practice:
* What is a MVC pattern
* Create a simple MVC application with the Thymeleaf
* Configuration via XML
* Configuration via config-classes
* Annotations @GetMapping(post, put, delete etc...), @RequestMapping
